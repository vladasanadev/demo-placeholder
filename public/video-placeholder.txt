ADD YOUR VIDEO FILE HERE

To make the video background work:

1. Add your video file to this public folder
2. Name it "sample-video.mp4" (or update the path in src/App.js)
3. For best results, use MP4 format under 50MB

The website will still work without a video, but you'll see a black background instead.
